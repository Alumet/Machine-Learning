#Random personal projects

Random projects with no intended goals. I started them mainly to experiment and learn new technics or technologies. 

##Neural_Network

Simple Neural Network generator based on NumPy + SciPy
- sigmoide activation function
- stochastic gradient descent
- back propagation)

The aim was to understand and experiment with Neural Networks. 
This project was inspired by Neural Networks Demystified series by "Welch Labs" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs.
